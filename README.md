# Lem-in

## 🏗️ 42 Project - Lem-in
Lem-in is an algorithmic project from 42 school that focuses on finding the optimal path for moving a set number of ants through a network of rooms and tunnels while respecting specific constraints.

## 📜 Description
The goal of this project is to create a program that analyzes a given map input and determines the best way to move the ants from the start to the exit.

### 🔹 Constraints:
- Only one ant can move through a tunnel at a time.
- All ants must reach the exit room as quickly as possible.
- Multiple paths can be used in parallel.

## 🚀 Installation & Compilation
Clone the repository:
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/lem-in.git
 cd lem-in
```

Compile the program using `make`:
```sh
make
```

## 📝 Usage
Run the program by providing a map as input:
```sh
./lem-in < map.txt
```
